This library attempts to conform to the https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml standard
and suggested implementation.

It diverges in the following places:

* The specification is vague about "Document Order". The default in this
  library is "depth first" document order (since that is element physical order
  in reading order), but you can choose "breadth first"
  when creating the machine to prefer a structural interpretation.
  This should only have a visible difference in
  parallel nodes that have nested structure deeper than one.
* Some sub-element types are not defined as elements, and are instead encompassed by attributes
  of the (would-be) parent.
* The specification requires certain XML-style things (such as supporting the explicit type
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#SCXMLEventProcessor" for `<send>`). Things like URLs
  may be replaced by an equivalently-functional thing.
