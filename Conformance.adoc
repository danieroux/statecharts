This library attempts to conform to the https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml standard
and suggested implementation. There are some notable exceptions, which
are documented here.

* Only early data binding is supported.
* The specification is vague about "Document Order". The default in this
library is "depth first" document order, but you can choose "breadth first"
when creating the machine. This should only have a visible difference in
parallel nodes that have nested structure deeper than one.
