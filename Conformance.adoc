This library attempts to conform to the https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml standard
and suggested implementation.

It diverges in the following places:

* All machine element names have been hyphenated for easier reading (e.g. `donedata` -> `done-data`)
** Some element arguments support a clojure-like notation (e.g. `autoforward` -> `auto-forward?`); However,
 for ease of translation from the SCXML spec these elements *SHOULD* still honor the non-modified
 name (i.e. `autoforward`).
* The specification is vague about "Document Order". The default in this
  library is "depth first" document order (since that is element physical order
  in reading order), but you can choose "breadth first"
  when creating the machine to prefer a structural interpretation.
  This should only have a visible difference in
  parallel nodes that have nested structure deeper than one.
* Some sub-element types are not defined as elements, and are instead encompassed by attributes
  of the (would-be) parent.
* The specification requires certain XML-style things (such as supporting the explicit type
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#SCXMLEventProcessor" for `<send>`). Things like URLs
  may be replaced by an equivalently-functional thing.
* `done-data` element uses an `expr` attribute instead of children.
* The specification says the `_event` should be placed in the data model
at various execution points, but is a bit unclear if it should be
contextual. This implementation:
** Always places the `:_event` at the location path `[:ROOT :_event]`,
which is meant to tell the data model to store the event in the top-level
context (on the root element, the machine).
** The data model keeps this value until the next event is processed.
