1.0.0-alpha3

* Various documentation updates
* MINOR API (breaking) change: delete op for data model now takes varargs instead of sequence.
* Improved validation
* Added is-in-state? (In) predicates to environment ns
* Added Flat working memory data model (no scoping)
* Fixed processing of send nodes so that `delay` `type` and `target` can be expressions
  for the execution model. You can still use `delayexpr` and such to differentiate if
  necessary.

1.0.0-alpha2

* Renamed protocol DataModel/transact! to `update!`, and changed argument to take :ops instead of :txn key.
* API for send changed slightly. :event is now just a name, and :data is for the extra data.

1.0.0-alpha1

* First release, NOT API stabel
